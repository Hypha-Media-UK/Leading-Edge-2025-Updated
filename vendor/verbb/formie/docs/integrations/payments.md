# Payments
Payment integrations are one of the provided integrations with Formie, and are used to capture payments (one-time, or subscription) when users fill out the form.

You can create Payment integrations by going to **Formie** → **Settings** → **Payments**. You can pick from a list of providers Formie supports, and provide details for connecting to their respective APIs. You can also create multiple Payment integrations, in case you need to connect to multiple, different providers.

:::warning
Due to their sensitive nature, it's highly recommended to store API keys in your `.env` file. This will also make switching from development to production easier.
:::

To use payment integrations in your form, add a Payment field to your form and select the configured integration to use.

## Supported Providers
Formie integrates with the following providers:
- BPOINT
